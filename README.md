# Wicked-West

_Wicked West_ is a top-down shooter game developed with the Unity game engine. This game is the product of a final group project for my _Intermediate Game Design and Development_ class at IUPUI. My group, _Midwest Games_, was composed of five talented game designers who all made great contributions to this game. I worked as the group's programmer, developing the game's movement, attacks, enemy AI, pickups, and level events in C#. Other group contributers include:
- Level Designer - [Jacob Shultz](https://github.iu.edu/jfshultz)
- Artists - [Kelly Cutshall](https://github.iu.edu/kelcutsh) and [Nelick Marcos](https://github.iu.edu/nmarcos)
- Animator - [Joseph Girard](https://github.iu.edu/joegirar)

The game currently has two playable levels, but it is still an early prototype. For more information on the game, as well as how to download the most recent version, visit its itch.io page [here](https://caleb765landis.itch.io/wicked-west).
